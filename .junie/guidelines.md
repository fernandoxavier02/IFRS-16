# Junie Guidelines

You must follow the repository-native context system.

## Primary Instructions
1. **Follow AGENTS.md:** Always adhere to the protocols defined in `AGENTS.md` at the repo root.
2. **Read Project Context:** Read `docs/ai/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` to understand the tech stack and commands.
3. **Active Retrieval:** Before proposing any change, search the repo and open the 3–10 most relevant files.
4. **Cite Sources:** Always end responses with: “Files read:” followed by exact paths.
5. **Stop Rule:** After 2 failed attempts at fixing something, STOP and produce a root-cause analysis.
6. **Privacy:** Never print secrets. Consult `.aiignore`.
